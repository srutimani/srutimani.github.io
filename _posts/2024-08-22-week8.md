August 22nd 2024 - Today, I we went to the Hillcrest Emergency Department to conduct our main study with our last two participants. This was a completely new ED with much smaller hallways so we were nervous about the robot's behavior. But, the robot performed very well for our final two studies which was great. The robot jitter in the beginning which was annoying seemed to also have fully stopped and run smoothly. We were happy to finish our study with our last two participants as we worked really hard leading up to the study.
