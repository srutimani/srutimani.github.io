August 5th 2024 - Today, the pHD student and I began system integration in order to integrate my clinician interface with the rest of the system. I was able to help with the websocket connection messages to ensure that the correct messages were being sent and received by the interface. The clinician interface websocket connection worked well and we ran into a few issues initially, but were able to figure it out in the end. The system integration will probably take most of this week in order to integrate fully. We also want to make sure there is enough time to pilot the study before our main study. We anticipate conducting pilots in the lab next week and a pilot in the hospital prior to our main study. We had been to the hospital a few times for mapping, but are yet to test the system integration.
