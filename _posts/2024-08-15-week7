August 15th 2024 - Today, we ran our main study at the La Jolla Emergency Department. We were able to get 9 participants for the feasibility study, which was definitely more than we expected. We were able to get participants because we went to the ED super early in the morning, around 6:30 AM so that we could set up and get started quickly. We got some great feedback and our study and system ran relatively smoothly, with very minor technical difficulties. We had practiced this study several times, so we were able to work in a team together well and get through any issues quickly. Overall the study ran well.
