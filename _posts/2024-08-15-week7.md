August 15th 2024 - Today, we ran our main study at the hospital. We were able to get a lot of participants for the study because we went to the hospital super early in the morning, around 6:30 AM so that we could set up and get started quickly. We got some great feedback and our study and system ran relatively smoothly, with very minor technical difficulties. We had practiced this study several times, so we were able to work in a team together well and get through any issues quickly. Overall the study ran well.
