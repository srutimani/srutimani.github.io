July 18th 2024 - Today, we had a meeting with my mentor in order to discuss updates regarding the system and the interface. I was given some great suggestions for how to improve my app and code documentation. I am continuing to complete all of the features of the app and hope to wrap up the main functionality by the end of next week. I also want to make sure that the app looks as identical to the Figma prototype as possible as I develop the new app features.
