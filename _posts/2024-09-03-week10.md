September 3rd 2024 - Today, I had a meeting with the PhD student as we both completed our individual qualitative analysis portion of the data. We spent several hours discussing our findings and open codes. We found some really cool themes and created an elaborate visualization of them, which will be used in our paper. I am sad that the program is coming to the end but I learned a lot and am excited to continue contributing to this paper.
