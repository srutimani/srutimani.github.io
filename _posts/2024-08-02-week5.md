July 29th 2024 - Today, my app was fully completed so we started some testing on the robot with labmates. My labmates were able to find many bugs in the app that I did not catch previously, so I spent a lot of time fixing those bugs. I also had a discussion with the PhD student to discuss which bugs were necessary to fix and which bugs we can fix for the next iteration due to time crunches.
