July 11th 2024 - Today, we were preparing for an interview with a clinician by conducting pilots with me and my other lab mate. Sandhya conducted the interview with me and timed it in order to practice for the actual interview. I also tested out the Figma interface and the two tasks that were supposed to run seamlessly and pointed out any bugs I noticed so that it can be fixed before the interview. Later in the day, we had a lab-wide meeting where we discussed everyoneâ€™s progress on their projects. Finally, we had our clinician interview and got some amazing feedback from the clinician about the interface. We should hopefully start testing out our entire system by next month and getting some more feedback from this clinician.
