July 1st, 2024 - Today is my first day of research in-person for the DREU program. Today, I worked on initial onboarding work such as gaining lab access and setting up all applications that I will need for the project. I had a meeting with Sandhya to discuss my personal tasks for the week as well as a lab-wide meeting to discuss progress on summer tasks and lab-wide announcements. Today, I compared React.js and Swift/XCode as options for app development, and identified that Swift/Xcode may be a better fit for the project at this time. 	
Since it was my first day, I met some of the other summer research interns and went on a quick coffee run with them as well! I got to know everyone better this way and I am excited to work with them on my summer tasks.
